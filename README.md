Most studies tend to use correlations between behavioral performance and electrophysiological indicators to find biomarkers of task time effects.
Due to the differences in task time effects among different tasks, using electrophysiological signals to monitor task time effects is a difficult problem in current research.


At present, the research on the changing rules of task time effect of working memory tasks under different cognitive loads is still insufficient. In addition, the existing research has not reached a unified conclusion on the neural markers of time effect under working memory tasks.


The cognitive load was adjusted by setting the task difficulty, and event-related potentials were used to study the task time effect under different cognitive loads.


ERP analysis is divided into 3 parts:
(1) First, the global field energy (GFP) of the ERP of each block was calculated, and the time window corresponding to the typical peak on the GFP waveform was statistically analyzed to determine the time period of interest for the ERP component of subsequent research.
Then, a two-factor repeated measures ANOVA of task difficulty*block was performed on the average amplitude of the ERP component of the whole brain within the time period obtained by GFP curve analysis.
